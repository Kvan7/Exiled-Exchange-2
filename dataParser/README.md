# Data Parser

See [main.py](./src/main.py) for the main entry point. This should be ran from the dataParser folder with the following command:

```bash
python ./src/main.py
```

You can use `--help` to see all options. Running with images will take forever so keep that in mind.

## Developing

I do development in a different private repo with this folder, if it doesn't look up to date let me know and I will try to push changes up to this repo.

If running the whole thing and pushing, you will need to change the `--main-repo-path` option since that has a default for when I run it from the other repo.
