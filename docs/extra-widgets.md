## Image Strip (Cheat Sheets){:.!mb-1}

*See also: [Widgets](/widgets)*{:.text-sm}

The Image Strip widget can be used to display an image in PoE2. This is most useful for quickly referencing a cheat sheet or other image. For best results, the image should be large and have a high resolution.

To enable the widget, open the overlay (`shift + space`), then hover over the 3 dots and click `Image Strip`.

## Stopwatch{:.!mb-1}

The stopwatch is a widget that can be placed anywhere on the screen. When the overlay is closed the stopwatch will remain on the screen. It can be started and stopped by either pressing Start, Stop, Reset button on the widget when the overlay is open. Or by binding the Start/Stop and Reset keybinds in settings.

To enable the widget, open the overlay (`shift + space`), then hover over the 3 dots and click `Stopwatch`.

To use this more realistically, you can bind the keybinds to your own keys. You can do this in the settings by hitting `Edit`. Remember to hit `Save` after changing the keybinds.
