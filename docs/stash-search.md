title: Stash Search
---

Save text to use for searching in the stash or vendors. You can also bind keybinds to these. While not affiliated, [poe2.re](https://poe2.re/waystone) is extremely useful for generating regexes for various things you want to search for. Check out the [PoE Wiki](https://www.poewiki.net/wiki/Guide:Regex) for more information on PoE's version of Regex.

To open the widget, press `Shift + Space` and then click either "Dump sorting" or "Map rolling" in the overlay. These are two Preset widgets but they can be customized to your liking. You can add as many of these widgets as you want, so do not feel limited by the presets.

## Map Rolling

Map(waystone) rolling is a preset widget that helps to match maps with certain mods on them.

Clicking any of these buttons will paste the text into the search bar in the stash or vendor window. For example, clicking "Burning Ground" will paste the text `"Burning Ground"` in the stash search bar. This will then highlight any map(waystone) that has that mod on it.

Here is what this looks like in settings for the widget.

## Dump Sorting

Dump sorting is a preset widget that helps to highlight certain items, particularly useful when going through a dump tab after mapping.

Clicking any of these buttons will paste the text into the search bar in the stash or vendor window. Example of searching for currency in a dump tab. This will then highlight any item that contains "currency" in it's description.

## Aliases and Hotkeys

The bottom one ("Default") has been assigned a hotkey for convenience, `F2`. When in the stash, just pressing `F2` will automatically perform that search without even opening the overlay. The hotkey is also visible in the overlay when it is opened, and can toggle all the hotkeys for the widget on and off with the switch in the top right of the widget.

In these settings, the actual regex is shown. It is quite unreadable and thus all of these use "Friendly Names", basically flavor text that is displayed in place of the actual used text.

## Settings

Inside the settings of the widget, each saved search can be edited, deleted, moved around, be given an alias, and have hotkeys assigned to them.
