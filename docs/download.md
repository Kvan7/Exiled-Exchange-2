### Moving from POE1/Awakened PoE Trade

**IMPORTANT:** If you are following this, all steps are required. Most problems occur with not doing step 7.

1. Download latest release from above
2. Run installer
3. Run Exiled Exchange 2
4. Launch PoE2 to generate correct files
5. Quit PoE2 and EE2 after seeing the banner popup that EE2 loaded
6. Copy `apt-data` from `%APPDATA%\awakened-poe-trade` to `%APPDATA%\exiled-exchange-2` to copy your previous settings
  - Resulting directory structure should look like this:
  - `%APPDATA%\exiled-exchange-2\apt-data\`
    - `config.json`
7. **IMPORTANT:** Edit `config.json` and change the value of "windowTitle": "Path of Exile" to instead be "Path of Exile 2", otherwise it will open only for poe1
8. Start Exiled Exchange 2 and PoE2
