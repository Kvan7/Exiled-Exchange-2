title: Map Check
---

Allows you to individually check maps for mods. Individual mods can be tagged as 3 different tiers and when checking a map, if that mod is on it, it will be highlighted in that color. Clicking a modifier will cycle through the tiers and save that for the next time a map is checked. Three different profiles are available, able to be switched with the 3 buttons on the top right.

All of the modifiers are also able to be manually edited in settings. A specific mod can be searched for, all mods with specific tiers can be filtered, and new mods can be filtered. For each mod the tier it belongs in can be changed or removed by clicking the x. Remember to click "Save" to save the changes.
